# Sublime Text Setup Wiki
#### This project's aim is to enable people to get started with Sublime Text much more quickly by showing which the best plugins are to use. Plugins can turn Sublime from a good text editor into a true power house, or IDE, for almost any writing/coding task.
#### Start with the [essential packages](https://github.com/mrmartineau/SublimeTextSetup/wiki/Essential-packages), you will definitely want to install Package Control (so that installing other plugins are much easier), then browse through the other guides.
